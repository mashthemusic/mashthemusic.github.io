Honey Harper music is hard to distinguish, its a mix of cosmic country, glam country, folk and indie rock.

Honey Harper’s celestial cosmic country debut album Starmaker, is now available everywhere.  Starmaker comes as a collection of contradictions in both subject matter and style. Written with his wife and writing partner Alana Pagnutti over the past three years, the album itself is primarily about the journey to create it. Its self-awareness is largely the result of Harper’s inner monologues about his fear of failure, desire for success, and the toll that journey has taken on him and his loved ones. It’s an attempt at honesty through the veil of a country singer lost in the stars.
