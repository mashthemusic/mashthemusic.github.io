Boysen learned classical guitar and piano as a child. He moved to Berlin in the early 2000s, setting up a studio called Hecq Audio, and composed electronic music under the alias Hecq from 2003. As Hecq, he released music in a variety of electronic styles, including glitch, ambient, breakcore, abstract IDM, and dubstep, mostly on the label Hymen Records.

In 2014, he was featured (under his given name) in the lead track of Jon Hopkins's LateNightTales release. He signed with Erased Tapes and released two full-lengths to date as Ben Lukas Boysen. The first, Gravity, was originally issued in 2013, but was reissued by Erased Tapes in 2016; the second, Spells, appeared in 2016 as well.

Boysen also does soundtrack work and has written pieces for entities such as Marvel and Amnesty International.
