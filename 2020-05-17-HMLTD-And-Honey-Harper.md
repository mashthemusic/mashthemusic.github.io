## HMLTD And Honey Harper

As promised, I have made music art posts for HMLTD and Hoeny Harper, their latest 2020 records I have been put on constant repeat to day, they are very diferent types of music but shard similar degrees of common things between them not only beginning with H and have new albums in 2020.

They share the same similarities of recording music thats addictive, infectious, and flowing, so few music artists that can have the formula in a music LP record. 

I particularly love the songs To The Door, Satan, Luella & I, and Blank State from HMLTD's West Of Eden, and Suzuki Dreams, Strawberry Lite, and Starmaker from Honey Harper's Starmaker album. 

Other than that, I am gathering more and more information on the artist pages as promised. Will keep you further posted.
