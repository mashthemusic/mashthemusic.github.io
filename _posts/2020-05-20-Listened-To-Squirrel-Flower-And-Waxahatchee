# Listened to Squirrel Flower, Waxhatchee And Boniface

Been another long day after a long durarion at work especually with the heat going up a notch. During work listening to the latest record of Squirrel Flower and Waxahatcher, both music artists in the folk genre with a lot of similarities between them, would highly recommend!

Will add these two artists also in the next few days.
