# Day 5 Of Tim Burgess Listening Party

Really loving Tim Burgess's Listening Party on twitter @t√¨m_burgess on feel good Friday ehrre I also listened to Half Waif, I Break Horses and Josef Salvat - all new albums this year in 2020, for TIis Twitter Listening Party I heard some more of the great lesser well known albums aswell as the great nod to Dexy's Midnight Runners. Learnt of a new band to me called Let's Eat Grandma!

And great nod to THe Streets Original Street Material. Steel feels fresh as it was back then . Thanks Mike Skinner!
