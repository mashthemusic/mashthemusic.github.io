# Bombay Bicycle Club - Everything Else Has Gone Wrong

This is certainly Bombay Bicycles electronic synth album in comparison with their other previous albums with mellow huey guitars, electronic beats backing vocalisation.

Is It Real has bouncy chanting coupled with addictive guitar hooks and fast electronic beats.

Let You Go is a strange one, with the unusual lyrics with its many layered chopped vocals but keeping to that same electronic sound in the background.

Eat, Sleep, Wake is certainly the more indie sound of their past, perhaps its a nod of what they reached so far, and is a tribulation song for reuniting back after 5 years (it is their first single released of their album)
