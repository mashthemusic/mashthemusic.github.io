# Day 2 Of To Tim Burgess Listening Party
Really loving today of Tim Burgess's Listening Party on twitter @t√¨m_burgess and on https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/ , today I loved The Subways album Young FOr Eternity, one of the first post punk revival bands to release an album in 2005, and got to learn more about the band Mercury Rev!
