# Synth Pop Influences And Discovery

Today and yesterday, I had discovered many bands and albums taht I haven't heard of at all and should of listened to when I had the chance after discovering the synthpop starter pack from the youtuber needledrops.
This starter pack that I have tweaked from needledrops initial list is music I am going to be listening over the course of this weekend, next week and that weekend.
It certainly has opened my mind of synth pop with the likes of 80's bands like Yellow Magic Orchestra, Devo and of course Gary Numan, but also SOft Cell and Pet Shop Boys which I have collected over the last yeard of their records.
I will also include some of my thoughts of the bands and the album that defines synth pop that you must listen to, with a touch of old and new. Today I discovere danother band called Bronski Beat after listening to Shopping's All Or Nothing and have cited this band as one of their influences aswell as my favourites Yeah Yeah Yeah's, LCD Soundsysstem and Talking Heads from Under The Radar's website interview from the self portrait of Shopping. THe album is much more synth pop than their previous efforts yet it is also an eye opener.

Heres my synth pop starter pack that you should listen to .
