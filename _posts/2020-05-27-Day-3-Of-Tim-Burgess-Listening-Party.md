# Day 3 Of To Tim Burgess Listening Party

Really really loving today of Tim Burgess's Listening Party on twitter @t√¨m_burgess and on https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/ , today I got to listen to Duran Duran Rio album which is an all time 80's classic, and from what SImon Le Bons has said fake white boy rap! I also got to listen to TIm Burgess's new album I Love THe NEw Sky which is full of mellow self-reflecting ballads, its a great album and the first time I heard of his solo work! I have also added his music profile today!
