# Listened to Four Tet, Man Man And Boniface

Been yet another long sunny day after a decisive day of work information overload with the heat going up a notch even more. During work listening to the latest record of Man Man and Boniface (again), would highly recommend!

For the first tiem ever, I listen to FOur Tet end to end properly on hsi altest album Sixteen Oceans, what a beautiful abum, so soothing uplifting experimental ambient music not sure what the theme is on but it reminds me of listenign to the hustle and bustle of the seaside and the car trips going there!

Will ne sure to add these two artists also in the next few days.
