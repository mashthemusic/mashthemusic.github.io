# Listened to Badly Drawn Boy

Badly Drawn Boy is back after 8 years from the wilderness with a fresh album of 2020 called Banana SKin Shoes. What is clearly apparent is that the lyrical mellowness, quirkiness and emotions are still packed in every song. 

It is much in the same vein of the album Hour Of Bewilderbeast in its style, which I love with a slight hint of more experimentation on the background sounds.

Give it a listen when you can! Was worth it during the bank holiday weekend!
