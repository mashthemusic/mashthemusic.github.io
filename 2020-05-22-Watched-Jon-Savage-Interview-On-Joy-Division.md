# Watched Jon Savage Interview On Joy Division

Been another long day after a long duration at work and finished early at 4pm. Jumped straight ln this music interview with Jon Savage from David Fricke about Joy Division.

It feels like a personal intimate account from Jon Savage about his experiences of the music from Joy Division, his accpints of him being fairly close tp the band sdurong late 1970s to the point of Ian Curtis's death andon the influence of the music ot has had on him
It's really interesting from his viewpoint and asspcoates with his recent book release, The Searing Light, The Sun and Everything Else - Joy Division : The Oral History.
